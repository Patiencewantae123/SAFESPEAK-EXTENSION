# SafeSpeak Chrome Extension

**SafeSpeak** is an AI-powered Chrome extension designed to detect, report, and combat online harassment and gender-based abuse on social media and other digital platforms. Built with Google AI technologies, SafeSpeak provides real-time protection and support for women and girls online, aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) to eliminate violence against women and foster gender equality.
