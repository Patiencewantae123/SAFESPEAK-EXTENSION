# Security Policy for SafeSpeak

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At SafeSpeak, we prioritize the security of our users and the integrity of our platform. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

1. **Confidentiality**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
2. **Contact Information**: Send an email to [patience.cui.g@gmail.com] or create a private issue in the repository to report the vulnerability. Include the following details in your report:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
3. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will provide a timeline for addressing the issue.

## Accepted Types of Vulnerabilities

We are particularly interested in vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of the SafeSpeak platform, including:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Vulnerabilities allowing the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.
- **Injection Flaws**: Including SQL injection, command injection, or any other form of injection that allows unauthorized commands or data manipulation.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Issues that allow unauthorized commands to be sent from a user that the application trusts.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Any method that may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data.

## Preventive Measures

To maintain the security of the SafeSpeak project, we encourage all contributors and users to follow these best practices:

- Regularly update dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
- Use secure authentication methods and ensure all sensitive information is stored securely.
- Conduct regular code reviews and security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities.
